JUST CODE README

Create a financial app which interacts with a user at a Point of Sale terminal. 
The app scans the userâ€™s purchase total, and gives the option to round up to the next whole dollar (or other specified figure)
The app then provides a menu of options of where to send the extra funds. The funds could be sent to a savings account, a  charity, a mutual fund or other investment. 
The app would also print a receipt showing the value of the original bill, the rounded up value, and how much was
 committed to each account. 
The initial development stage would involve creating the UML, the user interface, and the functionality of adding and subtracting dollar amounts. 


Future functionality
The app could provide access to a database which stores customer account profile data, balance, fund choices.
It could also track the progress of the chosen fund from real market data, and return the resulting change in value to balance. 
The app might also give the option to add a new fund or charity.
